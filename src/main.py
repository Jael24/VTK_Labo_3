    # The vtkRenderWindowInteractor class watches for events (e.g., keypress,
    # mouse) in the vtkRenderWindow. These events are translated into
    # event invocations that VTK understands (see VTK/Common/vtkCommand.h
    # for all events that VTK processes). Then observers of these VTK
    # events can process them as appropriate.

    #
    # By default the vtkRenderWindowInteractor instantiates an instance
    # of vtkInteractorStyle. vtkInteractorStyle translates a set of events
    # it observes into operations on the camera, actors, and/or properties
    # in the vtkRenderWindow associated with the vtkRenderWinodwInteractor.
    # Here we specify a particular interactor style.

    #
    # Unlike the previous scripts where we performed some operations and then
    # exited, here we leave an event loop running. The user can use the mouse
    # and keyboard to perform the operations on the scene according to the
    # current interaction style.
    #

    #
    # Initialize and start the event loop. Once the render window appears, mouse
    # in the window to move the camera. The Start() method executes an event
    # loop which listens to user mouse and keyboard events. Note that keypress-e
    # exits the event loop. (Look in vtkInteractorStyle.h for a summary of events, or
    # the appropriate Doxygen documentation.)
